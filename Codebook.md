<h1> Source <h1>
The data was downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The data extraction is not shown in the run_analysis.R file.

<h1>Steps</h1>: 

1. The files on the training folder and test folder were read along with features and activities. 
Two separate datasets were merged into one using cbind() and rbind()

2. The columns are named appropriately by assiging the contents of features.txt file as column headers for the x_train and x_test files. 
The y_train and y_test and the subject and activity dataset columns named too. 

3. The columns containing the mean or std are found out using grep() command. They are stored in "meandev".
"meandevsub" merges the "meandev" dataset with respective activity name

4. Creating a second dataset with the average of each variable for each subject and activity. Stored in "tidyset"
Wrote the table into a .text file uploaded in the repo. 


Find the variable names of TidySet.txt given below

"subjectId" "activityId" "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y" "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z" "tBodyAcc-std()-X" "tBodyAcc-std()-Y" "tBodyAcc-std()-Z" "tGravityAcc-mean()-X" "tGravityAcc-mean()-Y" "tGravityAcc-mean()-Z" "tGravityAcc-std()-X" "tGravityAcc-std()-Y" "tGravityAcc-std()-Z" "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X" "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y" "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z" "tBodyAccJerk-std()-X" "tBodyAccJerk-std()-Y" "tBodyAccJerk-std()-Z" "tBodyGyro-mean()-X" "tBodyGyro-mean()-Y" "tBodyGyro-mean()-Z" "tBodyGyro-std()-X" "tBodyGyro-std()-Y" "tBodyGyro-std()-Z" "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-X" "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Y" "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Z" "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-X" "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Y" "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Z" "tBodyAccMag-mean()" "tBodyAccMag-std()" "tGravityAccMag-mean()" "tGravityAccMag-std()" "tBodyAccJerkMag-mean()" "tBodyAccJerkMag-std()" "tBodyGyroMag-mean()" "tBodyGyroMag-std()" "tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()" "tBodyGyroJerkMag-std()" "fBodyAcc-mean()-X" "fBodyAcc-mean()-Y" "fBodyAcc-mean()-Z" "fBodyAcc-std()-X" "fBodyAcc-std()-Y" "fBodyAcc-std()-Z" "fBodyAcc-meanFreq()-X" "fBodyAcc-meanFreq()-Y" "fBodyAcc-meanFreq()-Z" "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-X" "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y" "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z" "fBodyAccJerk-std()-X" "fBodyAccJerk-std()-Y" "fBodyAccJerk-std()-Z" "fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq()-X" "fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq()-Y" "fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq()-Z" "fBodyGyro-mean()-X" "fBodyGyro-mean()-Y" "fBodyGyro-mean()-Z" "fBodyGyro-std()-X" "fBodyGyro-std()-Y" "fBodyGyro-std()-Z" "fBodyGyro-meanFreq()-X" "fBodyGyro-meanFreq()-Y" "fBodyGyro-meanFreq()-Z" "fBodyAccMag-mean()" "fBodyAccMag-std()" "fBodyAccMag-meanFreq()" "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean()" "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std()" "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-meanFreq()" "fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()" "fBodyBodyGyroMag-std()" "fBodyBodyGyroMag-meanFreq()" "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()" "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()" "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-meanFreq()" "activityType"
