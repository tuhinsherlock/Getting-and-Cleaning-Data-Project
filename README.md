<h1>GETTING AND CLEANING DATA  - COURSE PROJECT</h1>


This is a peer reviewed course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data" by Johns Hopkins University.

The aim of the project is to help us to be able to extract, read and manipulate data and create tidy data sets. 

<h3>Files</h3>

CodeBook.md describes the how to use all this, variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. 

The tidy dataset output is called TidySet.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
